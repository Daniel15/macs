# From scratch

This is the process I went through after getting a new Mac. This is installation and configuration of the mac.

1. Setup Chrome
  - Open and log in to Chrome
  - Let extensions and configuration sync
2. Allow installing third party packages
  - System Preferences > Security & Privacy
  - Select and save "Allow apps downloaded from anywhere"
3. Only require password 5 seconds after lock
  - System Preferences > Security & Privacy
  - Select and save "Require password 5 seconds after sleep or screen saver begins"
4. Install RDM __(controls resolution of screen)__
  - https://github.com/avibrazil/RDM
5. Launch RDM and change resolution to desired setting
6. Launch and sign in to Mac App Store
7. Install Divvy __(window manager for mac)__
8. Enable accessability for Divvy
  - System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Privacy > Accessibility
  - Add/Enable Divvy
9. Launch Divvy and add desired shortcuts
  
TODO: Make things launch on startup (RDM, Divvy, Activity Monitor, Outlook, Wunderlist)
TODO: Multiple screens and swiping between spaces
